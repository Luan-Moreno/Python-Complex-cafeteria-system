# Python-Complex-cafeteria-system
A complex Python project, which is a cafeteria system where the customer can place an order, cancel an order, add an item, cancel an item and ask for the bill and statement.  It was made using only base Python, mostly with arrays with data from external files.  Customer data is permanently saved unless the customer explicitly requests that it be deleted.
